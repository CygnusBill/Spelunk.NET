# Archived Documentation

This directory contains early design documents, requirements, and status reports that have been superseded by the current implementation. These documents are kept for historical reference but should **not** be used for current development.

## Contents

### Early Design Documents
- **MCP-Roslyn-Requirements.md** - Original requirements document (fully implemented)
- **SIMPLE_EDIT_TOOL.md** - Early edit tool design (superseded by statement-level operations)
- **SURGICAL_EDIT_DESIGN.md** - Early surgical edit concept (evolved into current edit-code tool)
- **STATEMENT_OPERATIONS_DESIGN.md** - Early statement operations design (implemented differently)
- **SYMBOL_SEARCH_PATTERNS.md** - Early search pattern ideas (superseded by SpelunkPath)
- **ROSLYN_SEMANTIC_SYNTAX_DESIGN.md** - Early notes on semantic/syntax transitions (incorporated into main design)
- **SPELUNK_PATH_REDESIGN.md** - Parser redesign proposal (partially implemented)

### Status and Test Reports (Snapshots)
- **TEST_COVERAGE_REPORT.md** - Test coverage snapshot (outdated)
- **TEST_EXECUTION_SUMMARY.md** - Test execution snapshot (outdated)
- **TESTING_INFRASTRUCTURE_ISSUES.md** - Testing issues at a point in time (resolved or superseded)
- **TOOL_QUALITY_ANALYSIS.md** - Tool quality assessment snapshot (outdated)
- **FSHARP_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md** - F# implementation status snapshot (outdated)

## Why These Are Stale

These documents represent the evolution of our thinking and snapshots of project state but have been replaced by:

1. **Statement-Level Operations** - A more refined approach than early designs
2. **SpelunkPath** - A comprehensive solution that supersedes simple pattern matching
3. **Current Tool Implementations** - The actual implementations differ from early concepts
4. **Living Documentation** - Current status is maintained in active docs, not snapshots
