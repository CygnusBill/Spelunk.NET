# Archived Documentation

This directory contains early design documents and requirements that have been superseded by the current implementation. These documents are kept for historical reference but should **not** be used for current development.

## Contents

- **MCP-Roslyn-Requirements.md** - Original requirements document (fully implemented)
- **SIMPLE_EDIT_TOOL.md** - Early edit tool design (superseded by statement-level operations)
- **SURGICAL_EDIT_DESIGN.md** - Early surgical edit concept (evolved into current edit-code tool)
- **STATEMENT_OPERATIONS_DESIGN.md** - Early statement operations design (implemented differently)
- **SYMBOL_SEARCH_PATTERNS.md** - Early search pattern ideas (superseded by RoslynPath)
- **ROSLYN_SEMANTIC_SYNTAX_DESIGN.md** - Early notes on semantic/syntax transitions (incorporated into main design)

## Why These Are Stale

These documents represent the evolution of our thinking but have been replaced by:

1. **Statement-Level Operations** - A more refined approach than early designs
2. **RoslynPath** - A comprehensive solution that supersedes simple pattern matching
3. **Current Tool Implementations** - The actual implementations differ from early concepts
